    "This lab is different from the others. You will work with a partner to find an astrostatistics paper that uses a neural network. Read the paper, download any associated code, and reproduce the main results in this notebook. You may (and are encouraged to) use code prepared by the authors. You and your partner will then prepare a 5 minute presentation to be delivered in class next week. \n",
